# Interactive Portfolio

This was a project to create an interactive portfolio webpage using ThreeJS. 

The concept was to allow the user to control a car to drive through a road nnetwork, where billboards would be positioned to introduce my portfolio to the visitor.

It was also a chance for me to learn ThreeJS, 3D modelling in Blender, and photoshop/ graphic design.

As I am unsatisfied with the final product, this will not be published on my main website, but you can try it out at [https://hubertchoo.github.io/InteractivePortfolio/](https://hubertchoo.github.io/InteractivePortfolio/).

Perhaps I will come back to this project one day.

Cheers
